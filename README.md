# Predicting Yelp Ratings

This project aims to predict the star ratings of Yelp businesses based on various attributes. The dataset used for this analysis includes information on different business characteristics, such as the number of reviews, whether the business accepts credit cards, availability of WiFi, and more. We employ a linear regression model to understand how these factors influence the star ratings.

## Project Overview

Yelp is a popular platform where users can rate and review businesses. Understanding what influences these ratings can help businesses improve their services and customer satisfaction. This project builds a linear regression model to predict the star ratings based on business attributes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical modeling
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive computing environment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yelp-ratings-prediction.git
    ```
2. Change into the directory:
    ```bash
    cd yelp-ratings-prediction
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # On Windows
